# Hire Musicians - Database Design

**Author:** Sankalp Susil Kumar Biswal  

## Overview
This repository contains the SQL part of the 'Hire Musicians' project, a proposed web application that aims to streamline the process of hiring and booking musicians.

## Project Proposal
The SQL scripts and database design documented here represent the foundational data structure intended for the future development of the 'Hire Musicians' web application.

## SQL Scripts
The repository includes SQL scripts for:
- Creating tables
- Inserting initial data
- Sample queries for operations like booking and searching for musicians

## Database Schema
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for database structure
- Description of table relationships and constraints

## Current Status
- The project is at the proposal stage with the SQL component completed.
- Web application development is pending.

## Usage
- SQL scripts can be executed in any SQL database environment to set up the proposed database structure.
- The ERD provides a visual representation of the data model.

## Contribution
Feedback and contributions to this proposal are welcome as we move toward the development phase of the web application.
